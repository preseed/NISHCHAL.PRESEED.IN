                        “Once, about 5 years ago I was asked where do I see myself 20 years from now. <br>
                        I said, “pitching myself to the people of India, as a candidate for the job of <br>
                        Prime Minister of India”. The traditional Indian investor said, “I was too <br>
                        delusional even for the most ambitious 30 year old”. I said, “That depends on<br>
                        how you look at it. I have learned over the years that an ambition that is large, is<br>
                        often perceived as delusional, if you are a friend. And if you are a client, then <br>
                        illusional or too good to be true”. They both had a good laugh. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        “I am mostly content pursuing my lofty goals as an entrepreneur. The only<br>
                        reason I would like to be a prime minister one day is because I don’t want to let <br>
                        anyone have the power to put anyone in jail without clear evidence against that <br>
                        person for that crime. The recent threat of not fascisim as much as, the<br>
                        normalisation of gross misuse of law, in India, is the greatest human rights <br>
                        threat to the loud courageous voices among 130 crore people<br>
                        among us. I want
                        to be the prime minister who puts justice as his first in the list of priorities. <br> Then
                        development. And then
                        religion, if religion manages to endure<br>
                        till 2050.
                        Thereafter, the country can finally be free to say what it wills,<br>
                        without the fear
                        of being prosecuted for saying something they believe to be<br>
                        true”. I know that
                        is my last goal of working life and I am not scared to <br>
                        mention it. I want to leave
                        my work when I am satisfied with the level of <br>
                        freedom a human feels in his day
                        to day. And in that I observe, that men <br>
                        languishing in prisons for no established
                        crime, let alone, that it was done <br>
                        by the accused, deserve 'freedom', the most.
                        This change will be the start to the <br>
                        genuine overhauling of the entire criminal justice
                        system over the next 30 years<br>
                        across the world. A prime minister of India has the power to do
                        that.

                        research and development essays. I need you to

                        Imagine an energetic child in school, class 1. He has 12 years to learn, to <br>
                        get to the next phase. I am right there in my goal to become a prime minister. I have <br>
                        much to learn over the next 20 years. All I have acquired well is the intent and space where
                        knowledge <br>
                        happens. Now I will leave it for your criticisms and opinions to drive me forward <br>
                        in my further enquiries in life. I thrive on it. Your opinions on politics and religion<br>
                        is going to help me get more knowledge across the next 20 years of my life <br>
                        about the fundamentals that will help humanity thrive by the time your children<br>
                        become your current age . The best part is, I am, through this large goal,<br>
                        opening myself to a new realm and I am glad I did so. I couldn’t have asked for <br>
                        more purpose in life. <br>
                        <br>
                        So far I have successfully imagined I believe the influence of social networks in <br>
                        India when designed for talks, as against the influence of social networks in the <br>
                        world when designed for evidence based productivity. <br>
                        <br>
                        Implying, no one will be spoken hatefully publically about anyone without any <br>
                        evidence against that person or belief. Twitter and Facebook are the places for<br>
                        you if you choose to do that. <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2020 we are in a mess of mythological stories presented as gods or religions<br>
                        with no proof of either or. Just beliefs. Very special and dedicated attention <br>
                        needs to be put to understanding life fundamentals before understanding <br>
                        the dance upon it. <br>
                        <br>
                        A great example is among the popular religions called Hinduism as the most<br>
                        holy. Need I say more about what many Hindus must have done to have made <br>
                        India so poor and unemployed, in spite of temples at every corner. Thank god <br>
                        other religions like Islam and christianity have started to begin being called out<br>
                        for their nonsense so by and large that I don't need to intervene. May that time <br>
                        come for Hindus too. I think its coming. <br>
                        <br>
                        The only religion practically possible to be practiced by a humble human being<br>
                        is a religion of - curiosity about fundamentals behind movement of mi
                        nd and stillness of mind. Vedic age was about that first, not temples and mass rituals. Just
                        stillness
                        and <br>
                        movement of smallest common particles the<br>
                        whole universe is geometrically aligned with. And thewhy? To know this <br>
                        why, that stillness called Samadhi is very important.<br>
                        <br>
                        Such is the kind of social community I wish to build. A community of <br>
                        curiosity, not religions".<br>

                        <br><br>

                        Along the way you will figure out the abstracts of how we are extrapolating our mission by
                        laying the foundation for the new education and criminal justice system. This is my end game.
                        Preseed is the incubator to incubate that plan of mine, just as it would do for you too, if you
                        have also got something conscious and inspiring.

                            I am doing things for you, for a better tomorrow for both you and I. If need be, I will be
                            willing to subject myself to an election campaign too, to someday after a few years from
                            today, to be your prime ministerial candidate. Consider my writings an evolving political
                            manifesto in that case, which will be frozen only 1 year before my entry into politics. I
                            want to give few more years to learn more lessons as I write in real-time. Must you not dig
                            me really deep? Be informed about who I am.

                            * I feel deeply about the empowerment of mothers. They are mostly home makers dependent on
                            the income brought by the husbands. I want to change that. I envisioned SFI as that product
                            during my stay back at home with my parents. this vision with a potential great food tech
                            startup like Hola Chef, for I believe, if. vision of SFI can scale Hola Chef globally. It
                            was during my research in matters of feminism that I came to two conclusions:
                            1. Mothers needs to be empowered financially.
                            2. Women-centric gender biased laws, be allowed to remain women centric gender biased.

                            We are starting Gencosys foundation to support the research and tapsya that goes into being
                            Nishchal. His being is very important to India. There are a very few men like him left in
                            India.
                            <br><br>
                            His words have a cathartic effect on us, in this world of agyan. Perhaps for he is able to
                            fragment
                            everything to its points of origin. Even god. He takes away the mysticism from mysticism.
                            <br><br>
                            Through our foundation:
                            <br><br>
                            1. We want to ensure that his words take an essay format on Medium.com.
                            <br><br>
                            Nishchal has invested himself totally in walking his talk through www.preseed.in. While we
                            think
                            the
                            words and vibe with which he is building www.preseed.in needs to also be written into a
                            book,
                            for
                            his words can even change the world one day.
                            <br><br>
                            It is his essays we intend to draft into a book, that can change India, if millions of you
                            read,
                            by
                            2025.
                            <br><br>
                            We will curate and make public on Nishchal's social media pages, information that will aid
                            in
                            the

                            "On Preseed Essays, among expressions of my own altruistic tech product, I am looking to
                            tackle
                            problems of isms like: <br>
                            1. fascism like divisive nationalism, <br>
                            2. patriarchy and the radical side of feminism*, the divisive feminism, which is often also
                            called
                            feminazism, <br>
                            3. divisive communalism/groupisms, <br>
                            4. illogical communism, <br>
                            5. and other isms like mindless consumerism that have the potential to divide the world
                            further".

                        Nishchal's blog, Preseed Essays, is my new big picture, because the politics of appeasement
                        has
                        not only affected society but the formation of laws as well.

                            Nishchal is beyond honor

                                a lot of novel work in, silently, already. In #JudicialSystem #PoliceReforms

                                tech-oriented future more than a myth induced history. He is an atheist who

                                not afraid to call a spade a spade, and a flake a flake. When he learns the
                                truth, he is not afraid to call you out on your shit in such times of

                                fiction has always revealed is coming. People are flooded by enormous amounts of
                                repetitive
                                information of past, which they don’t know how to make sense of, so they just do what
                                the
                                herd
                                does, follow each other, blindly, and mostly in surrender to their egos. I see my
                                mission as
                                bringing clarity to the public discussion especially in terms of focusing people’s
                                attention
                                on
                                the most important questions that will confront us in 5 years. Question and not answers,
                                for
                                I
                                don’t have all the answers. The important thing is, to agree about the questions. For
                                questions
                                will set the tone of our discourse for the sake of a better future. I would end by
                                saying
                                that
                                there are 10 big challenges to humankind in the 21st century- the nuclear war, climate
                                change,
                                technological disruption, pathetic criminal justice system, selfish capitalism or
                                mindless
                                consumerism, representative democracy, media accountability, no universal basic income,
                                parenting, and education system. These should be the first 10 items on the political
                                agenda
                                of
                                every country. If I have to mention one more it would be — finding happiness or at least
                                tranquility amidst these disasters, through Yog. My essays are about these.

                                I have added my own videos from my Youtube channel too in these essays at the right
                                places
                                so as
                                to put my things in perspective and I have requested you to even read the descriptions
                                on
                                youtube of each video from me as I describe matters beyond the respective video there.
                                In
                                totality, my effort on this essay are made up of about 60000+ words. So, if you go
                                through
                                them
                                you will go through, say, 12+ Chapters worth of reading to understand, how serious we
                                are
                                about
                                changing the world around you — through the culmination of it all into codes to make
                                that
                                change
                                as is expressed in the essays. If you can finish a small book of 12 chapters in 1 week,
                                amidst
                                your busy schedule, you can finish this too in one week.</i>
