                            We are a business advisory company in India called <b>Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd.</b> We are a result of our founder’s blog, this website - <a href="https://preseed.in/" target="_blank">Preseed</a>. His haters call him an objective asshole. You may too, if you can’t back your gut or ego with intelligent reasoning and facts. Even your belief in god needs to be addressed with that level of reasoning, just in case you wanted to touch that topic with him. For you are allowed to touch absolutely any topic in the universe with him. When he dives deep with you in realms that look subjective to you, he will still be being objective. He will have deep rooted reasons, and you will have to stretch your imagination to see those reasons.  It’s on you fellows, like it is on us, his team. Only if he sugarquoted and had filters, our lives would have been less intense, and he wouldn’t have been called an objective asshole. If you are looking for lesser intensity and sugarquoting. This is a wrong place. If you are looking to build some meaningful company or build Preseed further, this is THE place. 
                            <br>
                            <b>Disclaimer</b>: We will be timeless in our results, but not in our objective conduct towards action. The result of which will be your great company. 
                            <br>
                            This blog must be read well and to great lengths, however, it will never be perfect or complete. It’s chronicling our reality, as it moves forward, by the day. 
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            To us Nishchal is not an objective asshole. He is an all seeing eye, on a mission. And in that journey he cares about no one more than the mission itself. For it is in this mission he can actually take better care of one and all.
                            <br><br>
                            Even the strongest men in his situation would begin to conform to norms. Yet, he is not the man who will succumb to circumstances. Many times over the last 10 years he has hit rock bottom. Every penny he made, he invested in his software whims to do good in this society.
                            He continued to compensate his teams, over and above his own survival, to at times sleep
                            with no roof, cash, food and phone. Even his family lost all of it a long time ago when he
                            was barely 20. He was pressed by his family and well wishers to take up a job, for he was
                            receiving lucrative job offers by the day. He was criticised by those who ones loved him. A
                            person in his situation should have not survived. In this period of struggle, no one came
                            to his aid. He kept his head held high, didn’t take up a job and still sails forward like a
                            warrior on his mission to free the world from present structures, boundaries and meanings.
                            This journey is leading him into a true story of rarest courage and conviction, as it
                            unfolds before the world, in more action than words, over a long period of time.

                            If we had to describe Nishchal Kesarwani in one line to you, it would be impossible.
                            However, here is our failed attempt - He is the founder and a boundless leader at <strong><a
                                    href="http://www.chattodo.co/" target="_blank">Chattodo</a> </strong> and <strong><a

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            He lives in the world of extraordinary ideas, idealism, inspiration, simplicity, a bicycle,
                            a backpack, some yoga and lots of action. He questions, inspires and teaches us to be who
                            we are becoming on this journey together. He does this in his well informed, imaginative,
                            idealistic, bold and democratic style of leadership, unique only to him.<br>
                            He is Preseed’s first resident Yoga exponent and researcher.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            His life's purpose may be summed up as following :-
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            1. <strong>Karma</strong> - His purpose is to work in the area of liberating people through
                            technology entrepreneurship of the righteous intent, so that at least some of them could
                            truly and soulfully do that what is meaningful to their soul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. <strong>Dharma</strong> - He walks the path of karma also to help (wo)mankind make
                            progress through their own actions towards liberating them from their non scientific and
                            rigid beliefs of life and universe, so that they could do what they find harmony in. Hence,
                            his purpose is also to ensure that the soul is not ignored any more. His purpose is to
                            understand and impart the awareness of the god's vibe through yoga. </p>
                        <p>
                            3. <strong>Seva</strong> - His purpose is to ensure that each life he touches on this
                            journey to building products gets truly served in their righteous progress. This is how he
                            perceives the value of his products, not through the value of money.</p>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            The things he do in a day, enable him to stumble upon many teams with good ideas and a
                            strong will to build further upon their ideas, through their skills, perhaps even a sound
                            prototype, logistical and back end capabilities. Almost invariably, if he finds them good
                            enough to ping his mind, he would have views for them that could help them make further
                            progress. But these views are not mere theoretical views, these are strategies that need to
                            be executed beyond the current capabilities of the prototype team. So, in order to help
                            these teams at different stages of the startup life cycle we have allowed for such teams to
                            engage with Nishchal directly. Although, this will be useful when startup teams are willing
                            to stay focused on the strategy proposed by Nishchal, above all else.</p>

                            80% of what he does in a day is — he builds <strong>Chattodo</strong>. It is his most
                            important company. He leads it from the front. Everything else he does, is how he handles
                            the requests of other startups or clients with that 20% of his time left in a day, very
                            effectively with this cultural system, called <strong>Preseed</strong>. Chattodo is a
                            product of which, Preseed is a cultural manifestation. They both run the same blood and
                            vibe.
