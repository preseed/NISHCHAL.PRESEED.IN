            				may be coming. Why? Long ago, I asked myself the question about what is the one thing I must do with my capabilities
            				- the answer I got was - I must do everything I can, to give our world, better leaders. However, as I progressed I was
            				able to marry in vision, my previous failed social networking startup to become now, a more conscious social network

                  </div>
                  <div class="pem" align="left">We are a small culture in India called Preseed. We are running under
                    an unusual man’s leadership.
                    It’s his imagination, courage, knowledge and intellect, and the act of our people that make us
                    extremely valuable support to a man or a woman with a will to do something out of the ordinary. We
                    are
                    a result of his words expressed on his blog, this website - <a href="https://preseed.in"
                      target="_blank">www.preseed.in</a> and all its associated links.</div>

                  <div class="pem" align="left">We are with him in his culture due to the following attributes we have
                    observed in him:</div>

                  <div class="pem" align="left">1. His extraordinary mass consumer ideas.<br>
                    2. His courageous way of being, leading and creating.<br>
                    3. His ability to execute those ideas to become MVPs without a single penny. (This is the most
                    important point: it would have reduced the cost of important experimentation in India by more than
                    4x,
                    just as it has done for our organisation because of his bility to replace money with inspiration
                    among
                    one and all in our team, leading to really low costs of creation so far).<br>
                    4. His ability to communicate extremly complex ideas as smaller fragments effectively and
                    inspiringly
                    with our globally distributed remotes teams.<br>
                    6. His courage to do before anyone else and his ability to face odds before anyone else will face
                    them.<br>
                    He leads before he eats and he has only gotten started. </div>

                  <div class="pem" align="left">He teaches us to be patient, to persevere, to keep it going, to have
                    fun, to exercise and to be in
                    meditation.</div>


                  <div class="pem" align="left">His haters call him an objective asshole. You may too, if you can’t
                    back your gut or ego with
                    intelligent reasoning and facts. Even your belief in god needs to be addressed with that level of
                    reasoning, just in case you wanted to touch that topic with him. For you are allowed to touch
                    absolutely any topic in the universe with him. When he dives deep with you in realms that look
                    subjective to you, he will still be being objective. He will have deep rooted reasons, and you
                    will
                    have to stretch your imagination to see those reasons. It’s on you fellows, like it is on us, his
                    team. Only if he sugarquoted and had filters, our lives would have been less intense, and he
                    wouldn’t
                    have been called an objective asshole. If you are looking for lesser intensity and sugarquoting.
                    This
                    is a wrong place. If you are looking to build some meaningful company or build Preseed further,
                    this
                    is THE PLACE.</div>

                    of
                    holding hand comes in. It comes from his vast sea of imagination and knowledge. He delivers it
                    through, non-sugary words. That is his way of love. His way of love is in being, firstly a good
                    listener and then a good advisor. His advise comes without filters. Be ware, for, if he corrects
                    you
                    and you feel offended, then you have an ego problem. And if you have that problem, you may not
                    survive
                    Nishchal for too long.

                    <br><br>

                    To us Nishchal is not an objective asshole. He is an all-seeing eye, on a mission. And in that
                    journey, he cares about no one, not even himself, more than the mission itself. For it is in this
                    mission he can actually take better care of one and all.

                    <br><br>

                    Even the strongest men in his situation would begin to conform to norms. Yet, he is not the man
                    who
                    will succumb to circumstances. Many times over the last 10 years he has hit rock bottom. Every
                    penny
                    he makes, he invested in his software whims to do good in this society. He continued to compensate
                    his
                    teams, over and above his own survival, to at times sleep with no roof, cash, food and phone. Even
                    his
                    family lost all of it a long time ago when he was barely 20. He was pressed by his family and well
                    wishers to take up a job, for he was receiving lucrative job offers by the day. He was criticized
                    by
                    those who ones loved him. A person in his situation should have not survived. In this period of
                    struggle, no one came to his aid. He kept his head held high, didn’t take up a job and still sails
                    forward like a warrior on his mission to free the world from present structures, boundaries and
                    meanings. This journey is leading him into a true story of rarest courage and conviction, as it
                    unfolds before the world, in more action than words, over a long period of time.

                    <br><br>

                    He lives in the world of extraordinary ideas, idealism, inspiration, simplicity, a bicycle, a
                    backpack, some yoga and lots of action. He questions, inspires and teaches us to be who we are
                    becoming on this journey together. He does this in his well informed, imaginative, idealistic,
                    bold
                    and democratic style of leadership, unique only to him.
                    He is Preseed’s first resident Yoga exponent and researcher.
                    <br><br>
                    He is in his early 30s, and has a way to express his theory of no god or the origin of the
                    universe,
                    its end and what after the end, without using religion and mysticism. We have never known anyone
                    who
                    can express such complex ideas with such ease, passion and simplicity. When one asks him, how do
                    you
                    know all this and how do you dabble between spirituality and the material world of technology. He
                    says, "Firsly, none of what I know is my own. It is all just flowing through me. The reason for
                    that
                    is resonation. I am at the same frequency as the fundamental truth itself". And then he goes on to
                    explain how energy flows into each other and how shapes and forms take place. So, one of his
                    favourite
                    quotes is -

                  </div>

                  <br>
                  <blockquote class="text_cursive quote_part">&quot;I think the trouble with being a critical thinker
                    or

                    people
                    who are wrong without sounding like a fuckwit. People go ‘Do you think the vast majority of the

                    He is unabashed in praising you as he is unabashed in praising himself. He says, <i>"Why should I

                      a line in the way I talk about you when in praise, and the way I talk about me, when in self
                      praise.
                      Why should I treat you differently and I if we are both worthy. I like honesty far above and
                      beyond
                      humility"</i>. Yet he is humble. We love that. He may say not everyone is an equal, and then go
                    on
                    to prove it through frequencies of atoms rendering different shapes and forms. He is an
                    extraordinary

                  <div class="pem" align="left">
                    His life's purpose may be summed up as following :-
                    <br><br>
                    <b>1. Karma</b> - His purpose is to work in the area of liberating people through technology
                    entrepreneurship of the righteous intent, so that at least some of them could truly and soulfully
                    do
                    that what is meaningful to their soul.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Dharma</b> - He walks the path of karma also to help (wo)mankind make progress through their
                    own
                    actions towards liberating them from their non scientific and rigid beliefs of life and universe,
                    so
                    that they could do what they find harmony in. Hence, his purpose is also to ensure that the soul
                    is
                    not ignored any more. His purpose is to understand and impart the awareness of the god's vibe
                    through
                    yoga.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. Seva</b> - His purpose is to ensure that each life he touches on this journey to building
                    products gets truly served in their righteous progress. This is how he perceives the value of his
                    products, not through the value of money.
                    <br><br>
                    The things he do in a day, enable him to stumble upon many teams with good ideas and a strong will
                    to
                    build further upon their ideas, through their skills, perhaps even a sound prototype, logistical
                    and
                    back end capabilities. Almost invariably, if he finds them good enough to ping his mind, he would
                    have
                    views for them that could help them make further progress. But these views are not mere
                    theoretical
                    views, these are strategies that need to be executed beyond the current capabilities of the
                    prototype
                    team. So, in order to help these teams at different stages of the startup life cycle we have
                    allowed
                    for such teams to engage with Nishchal directly. Although, this will be useful when startup teams
                    are
                    willing to stay focused on the strategy proposed by Nishchal, above all else.

                    Nishchal is not a conventionally educated man. He dropped out of college. However, he is an

                    learned and observant man, but most importantly, he is a meditative man. He learned his early

                    it
                    reaches the rest of the world. It may have been painful to have lost that team, and starting from
                    scratch, from that rock bottom. This situation must have had something to do with Nishchal's new
                    found
                    raised bar at Preseed.

                    Somewhere along the way, Nishchal got offers from companies like <a

                    them
                    as a co-founder and director. He had to politely turned those offers down by those game-changing
                    men
                    and women. Nishchal was to be on a mission of his own. Something only he may be destined to do.
                    Today
                    those businesses are at over 200 million dollars in valuation, while Nishchal is building a

                    Over the years his $100,000 backed startup failure with the above-mentioned star-studded team in
                    2010
                    at his ripe age of 25, to starting Preseed as a community in 2012, up to now, Jan 2014, he often
                    finds
                    himself and his team  advising a lot of business owners and friends, who have come to us seeking
                    his
                    advice on new ways to do business in the new, ever changing age of free information and free
                    tools.
                    <br>

                    However, he has been so caught up until now in building from the ground up, upon his own ideas
                    listed
                    at <a href="http://preseeded.presed.in/" target="_blank">Preseeded</a> and that he never formally
                    got
                    the time to start our consulting for such businesses and startup friends out there, even though in
                    his
                    personal capacity, <b>in the past</b>, he <b>has advised and executed for companies like —</b>
                    <br></br>
                    1. <a href="http://www.libramattres.com/" target="_blank">Libra Mattresses</a> (among the top 5
                    mattress manufacturers in India) - Nishchal aided them in 2009–10 in improving their brand and
                    design.
                    They give his team's designs the credit for making one of their foam product their best seller.
                    <br></br>
                    2. <a href="http://www.indiamart.com/jeetindialtd/" target="_blank">Jeet India Limited</a> (a SME
                    in
                    food and beverage) — In 2009–10 Nishchal with his team (that later placed in organizations like
                    google
                    and O&M) worked on their brand, their packaging, their ERP, their IT infrastructure etc.
                    <br></br>
                    3. <a href="http://www.investcare.in/" target="_blank">Invest Care</a> — In early 2011 Nishchal
                    and
                    his team deployed IT infrastructure solutions for them through his other co-founded startup called
                    BizOnTech. (Note-: He dropped out of BizOnTech soon after to split from that team, to focus on
                    something more inspiring, that now is called <a href="http://www.preseed.in/"
                      target="_blank">Preseed</a>).
                    <br></br>
                    4. <a href="http://www.omsaiglobal.com/" target="_blank">Om Sai Global</a> — In the mean while to
                    make
                    ends meet Nishchal started advising Om Sai Global on harnessing the internet better and graduated
                    to
                    training their teams. Soon after he became the CEO there for a brief period of 3 months as that
                    allowed him more authority to attempt some overhauling in their company. He did not continue
                    thereafter for he was not motivated to serve real estate business.
                    <br></br>
                    5. Many more such business consulting stints happened till 2011 December, when he finally decided
                    to
                    not work as a consultant to SMEs anymore, to focus back on what mattered to him the most. What
                    mattered to him the most was building <a href="http://preseeded.presed.in/"
                      target="_blank">Preseeded</a>, which of course in those days around the mid of 2011 was just a
                    thought in his mind, without a form. For Preseeded, <a href="http://www.preseed.in/"
                      target="_blank">Preseed</a> had to happen first. <b>So he started building Preseed.</b>
                    <br></br>
                    His main interest of work always lied in building startups from bottom-up, for that leaves more
                    room
                    for some soulful innovation. He liked to innovate on even the way businesses are managed, let
                    alone
                    the product the business is building. His appetite for technology and good design transcends by
                    far
                    the appetite for technology and good designs in most businesses in India. (Although, ironically,
                    in
                    spite of having the skills and sensibilities, he is unable to devote time to improve designs on
                    his
                    own website :p).
                    <br></br>
                    His biggest challenge in consulting SMEs was that they often lacked the creative work force needed
                    to
                    execute what my advise may have contained for them. Hence, it was a fair decision by all regard to
                    stop advising others to focus back on starting up a business that fulfilled his desire to co-build
                    important things that mattered. So, <b>if you are building something important, that leads people
                      to
                      experience greater freedom in his perspective, count him in.<b></br>

                    When I was starting Preseed, I used to tell people that I am going to build a
                    company where I could float my many ideas and see them take shape.
                    The first step to building a company like that, was to build a culture like that
                    of a hand full of people who believed in not only my ideas but my world views.
                    The next step was to instill so much inspiration in them all that they go all
                    the way to enable me or assist me further to shape up those ideas.
                    The next step was to put them in order, a system, a set of protocols.
                    Now comes the next step. The step in which we create a very simple modal box for
                    each idea of ours and link it with MyIdealist, earlier called Idealistr.
                    This complete step if done right, including marketing, will have the potential
                    to blow things out of proportion for us, meaning, since the cost of
                    experimentation at Preseed is unbelievably low because of our altrusitic and
                    courage filled works, at such lower costs, now almost all our ideas can start
                    taking shape, from the moment we find an inspired hacker who is intrinsically
                    motivated to build that product with us, for reasons not only limited to the
                    goodness in the idea of the product, but because he sees the goodness in teaming
                    up with us.<br><br>
                    Similarly, MyIdealsit, will give you the dashboard to publish your ideas that
                    you have deeply thought of and from that moment on, would like to publish to be
                    read by your future teams.
                    This project will move forward to becoming a simple mobile app where your
                    network will get instantly notified everytime a new idea is added, so that they
                    can go to it's link on MyIdealist and know more about the idea or start a
                    dialogue with you about it right there.
                    <br><br>
                    There will be comments feature too. It will be a way of collecting testimonials
                    by those who have had the chance of having discussed the idea with us. (Rest of
                    the ability of commenting on the idea for the purpose of understanding the
                    idea - will be handled at MyIdealist). Here the commenting will serve the
                    purpose of marketing of your ideas.
                    <br><br>
                    MyIdealist will lead to creating a network of evangelists for your ideas. They
                    follow you based on your ideas and not because of your controversies.

                    <i align="center">So many people, incubators and initiatives together may not be
                      able to help entrepreneurs as much as one right web product. Reason - The

                      ecosystem but only Anglelist had the product vision to create the most
                      scalable product to contribute to this cause of boosting entrepreneurs

                    <br><br>
                    Blast from the recent past  from 2012 —  First, Nishchal started this community,
                    Preseed, as a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thepreseed">FB page</a> to
                    empower entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs personally through mentoring
                    them over my lectures in top colleges and through personal phone calls. Then,
                    with the lessons of running that community for 2 years Nishchal started to build
                    a web product called Idealistr in 2014 (find it in step 3 of <a
                      href="https://preseeded.preseed.in/">
                      preseeded.preseed.in</a>) to empower potential entrepreneurs, across the
                    world, by
                    suitably profiling them and making them discoverable. The main problem faced by
                    aspiring entrepreneurs who want to turn an idea into reality is getting good
                    talent. Idealistr aimed to solve that problem by helping change makers find the
                    right cofounders/volunteers for their idea to bring it to reality. Idealistr was
                    also meant to lay the foundation for attracting angel investors. This was a
                    product for philosophers, engineers, doers, remote coworkers, entrepreneurs and
                    aspiring entrepreneurs.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, Nishchal had been dreaming since 2009 to channel the creations of
                    technology students across the country towards solving real-world problems. So
                    there is a wholesome growth in our society of students and solution seekers,
                    which is the society as a whole. This can be achieved in a more social and
                    democratic ways than that can be seen so far for there is a vision for a very
                    noble cause but that vision needs to be translated into a vision for a web
                    product and not a mere website. Thus making it more scalable. And this is true
                    for us too.

                  They are the productive people, who collaborate and communicate upon
                  ideas and startups.<br><br>

                  Angellist is designed to facilitate a transition of a startup from more
                  than a 2 people team and beyond up to some real serious investments.
                  Idealistr was designed to facilitate a transition of a problem into a
                  narrative that could inspire future co workers.<br><br>

                  To help them better collaborate and communicate productively in more
                  novel ways, Nishchal started to build <a href="http://www.todoed.co">www.todoed.co</a> too, to back
                  his
                  vision for ultimately a chat app for entrepreneurs called
                  <a href="http://www.chattodo.co">www.Chattodo.co</a> .
                  <br><br>
                  <br><br>
                  If you are starting your journey as an entrepreneur now, you are exactly the person
                  we have built our chatting app Chattodo for. I have been that for 10 years.
                  Somewhere along the way in 2009, I got stuck at this problem of lack of efficiency
                  in communication on a mobile phone for an entrepreneur. Just that.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  2020 - Now minimum viable versions with some bugs here and there for all
                  of Nishchal's products are READY.

                    Todoed is made up of I(could be the ceo) and Dhaval(could be the cto) full time. And there are two
                    part time advisors (passive tech advisor - Saikiran and fairly active tech advisor/hands on
                    coder/backend Ansal). <br>
                    This is the Todoed core team - I and Dhaval. This is all I need. This, all the way to cover,
                    chrome extension(all to do with text - 75% done) and iOS (all to do with voice and text). This is
                    the iOS/backend/marketing/design team. <br>
                    It is Todoed on iOS that ultimately will solve my own problem fully that I envisioned it to do for
                    me first. Todoed as a chrome extension has been able to do it only partly. <br>
                    I started my journey to inspire ideas, faith (in each other), and action among all I come in
                    contact with. So, I started Preseed. Found Dhaval on that journey and mandated him to build upon
                    my vision for the product, that productifies Preseed, to enable more potential entrepreneurs to
                    build. The prototype is here <a href="http://myidealist.co">www.myidealist.co</a> . Now while
                    journeying over this I realised a problem with my own fellows and community at Preseed, where
                    actionable tasks sent over chat, kept getting lost. I told Dhaval to transfer the task of building
                    MyIdealist to our other coworkers at Preseed and join me asap at building Todoed. <br>
                    In brief the above paragraph should give you a glimse over my exact motivation: <br><br>
                    1. To make people more productive. <br>
                    2. For the purpose of building ideas. <br> <br>
                    Todoed should help people be more productive for the purpose of building ideas. Some day a text
                    with '#idea' in Todoed will create more possibilities for users of Todoed to transition that idea
                    into a MVP and then perhaps a startup. That day Todoed and MyIdealist will be very closely
                    integrated. But this year, that can even be a part of dialogue. Because this year is about
                    everything in Todoed except this '#idea'.
                    <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>
                    This is Todoed being built for the present or what I call 'the Todoed operational parallel': <br>
                    <br>
                    We get tremendous invaluable support from Preseed, the noise free community of self inspired
                    potential entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs, I started 3 years ago. That support will continue
                    forever. That support means the ball at Todoed is always rolling. The hustle is always on.
                    Independent of money, office, materials. It's a bonus. Large bonus. That is capable of producing
                    the product, even if Dhaval and I were not there. (But Dhaval is there, has been and will be,
                    forever, so had/have/will I. I have shared a profound and deeply action oriented relationship with
                    Dhaval for 2 years now). <br>
                    Preseed is now represented through Govind, coordinator at Preseed; to Raj, who handles Todoed at
                    Preseed, and hence is the coordinator at Todoed, meaning Raj's mandate is to extract the juices
                    out of the Preseed team/network for the purpose of building Todoed, independent of the works of
                    the core team of Todoed. <br>
                    Operational parallel: Raj; under my day to day directions and suggestions in freelance arrangement
                    with Ansal, and advisory from Kartik Mandavidalle; with an open access to human resources of
                    Preseed. This is how we have so far, Built the chrome extension; measuring it, learning it,
                    repeating it. All the way to making it the best productivity chrome extension in the world. This
                    is truly exactly the process that built Todoed thus far. And that is the exact process that will
                    continue to build it further over the next 3 months. <br>
                    We think our chrome extension will be perfect by that time. While this is going on, Raj will
                    continue to market the product and study the user metric and behavior. And then further market it
                    upon those lessons. This is all about the Chrome extension. <br>
                    So there is also Raj in the Todoed team. He was my second in command at Preseed. Now he is my
                    second in command in Todoed. <br>
                    Three of us are building Todoed at 0 costs to Todoed, from our own homes, I in Lucknow, Raj in
                    Kolkatta, Dhaval in Ranchi. Whatever little server/freelancer costs, Preseed/Preseed network takes
                    care of it. That is how we have done things and can do for a long period of time. We are,in one
                    regard, self sustained. <br>
                    However, if we raise money, I can raise the bar -: <br> <br>
                    <br> 1. I want to set up a beautiful conducive office/infrastructure in Lucknow to come under one
                    roof to build and grow a great roof to work from, physically also together, not just mentally.
                    <br> 2. Build the product to my satisfaction in 3 months, and take I and Dhaval to Silicon Valley
                    (leaving Raj and others to hustle in India), to work closely with a marketer/growth hacker who has
                    been there done that. We want to go to him with a product, which is ready to be marketed at his
                    full ability. I have the vision for the product, which can attract among the best marketers and
                    growthhackers in the world, if we can compensate them suitablly. (This is a 100% consumer web 100%
                    tech product and there is no reason for me to not build it from the place and in the neighbourhood
                    of people who have done it the best).
                    <br> -
                    <br> Love and Peace
                    <br> Nishchal

He said,  "Sometimes I just want to live a simple life, be in love, go to parties, drink and dance. Smoke pot and play sports. Travel the mountains and oceans. Make my own furniture. Roll in green meadows. Watch the stars and satellites. Just like any of you. My alter ego, however, at all times, wants to just build a great company that takes human culture, to freedom. For, I cannot unsee, what I have seen. And in my attempt to gratifying my senses, I may leave nothing for my children to cherish, but intoxication; unless I use my knowledge to see our children, in everyone, especially those who suffer".</figcaption>

                  <br><br>

                  Nishchal is here to sincerely help change your status quo, to ensure that you get at least one shot to
                  do something impactfully different. His attributes are as different as the result he wants to create,
                  even culturally. Some of those attributes of his we love while some others find amusing:
                  <br><br>

                  1) He rides bicycles and shows up for most meetings(and parties) in shorts and t-shirts, needless to
                  say, sweaty and muddy. He doesn’t care about what he is wearing and he also doesn’t care about what
                  you are wearing.
                  <br><br>
                  2) He has huge concerns over effective visual communications, especially if you are designing to
                  communicate with your customers for customers won't get into long verbose conversations with you. He
                  feels if you invest on communications right, it would really facilitate his task of ‘GROWING THE
                  COMPANY’. If you are an alive company with some real on the ground traction, sometimes, the first
                  job he may want to get done for you is getting this aspect of your business right. We hope we will
                  find you prepared to invest time and money on this.
                  <br><br>
                  Note -: Good designs seek good payments. If you are not willing to pay the graphic designers well,
                  we won’t take the responsibility of your visual communications. Actually this stands true for any
                  vendor services.
                  <br><br>
                  3) He may get really really profound and verbose at times, almost on a whim, but that's because he
                  has a very liberated sense of possibilities, passion backed with logics that may take you time to
                  comprehend just like most groundbreaking logics in physics may take time to comprehend.
                  <br><br>

                  4) He is even further north of the optimistic side, from other people’s perspectives (especially those
                  who are still found conducting business in traditional ways*). HE IS REALLY REALLY DREAMY, YET SIMPLE.

                  <br><br>
                  5) He never thinks not backed by an investor is a problem or a big deal, so you also please stop
                  assuming that it is. It definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it should not mean
                  you stop the hustle. Be creative in even how you make your ends meet. <i>Where there is a will there
                    is a way</i>. Look carefully at how he is trying to do the same for himself.
                  <br><br>
                  <b>Traditional ways :-</b><br><br>
                  A) Poor visual communication.
                  <br>
                  B) Without harnessing the internet.
                  <br>
                  C) Unclearly defined roles and responsibilities of the staff.
                  <br>
                  D) Uninspired management apart from the co-owners.
                  <br>
                  E) No Business plan.
                  <br>
                  F) Ineffective or delegation of tasks.
                  <br>
                  G) Unoptimized resource including the available human resource.
                  <br>
                  H) Little or no funding.
                  <br>
                  I) Disbelief and bad payments against exceptional quality.

                  <br><br>
                  At PRESEED YOGA these are also some of the aspects we work on.<br><br>
                  5) He never thinks money is a problem or a big deal, so you also please stop assuming that it is. It
                  definitely is a means to an end, no doubt, but not having it should not mean you stop the hustle.
                  <br><br>
                  6) He will say a point once and in most cases, it would be communicated to you in written words. We
                  already assume that you are inspired enough to take action on the point he has stated. So, don’t
                  expect us to send reminders or follow up till you yourself write to us telling us the status of
                  whatever the point of concern was. He hates to repeat. It's not an ego thing. It's the ‘duplication
                  of the same effort’ that he is against. It is the same as inefficiency.
                  <br><br>
                  7) Twitter is one of the best ways to get in touch with him. He prefer it over emails and phone
                  calls.
                  <br><br>
                  8) We hate to see his time getting wasted with you. You are not the only business/idea/goal/dream he
                  is dealing with. So, please value his time. Value your time too. If you save him time, he will most
                  certainly make this world a better place.
                  <br><br>
                  9) He is critical(but not over critical) and brutally honest. In fact so much that sometimes we lose
                  people for they get offended. But, that helps us in filtering bozos. We just hope you are not one of
                  them who we lose.
                  <br><br>
                  10) If you are not being creative and liberal, we are not interested in you.
                </p>
                <br>

                At PRESEED YOGA these are also some of the aspects we work on.

           <b>Q) Is your company Preseed Ventures Pvt. Ltd or an incubator or an investor of some kind?<br>
A)</b> Preseed is a virtual incubator primarily focused on incubating my own products first, which in turn are directly aligned with our mission of Freedom. Preseed takes inspiration in the way I think business ideas and hence, it stays focused on finding resources to empower him on his products first. The vision for the fund above is also really to find an investor who can create this fund which in turn enables us to continue finding more entrepreneurs like me who really want to do something genuinely meaningful. So, if the only way you can understand Preseed is by comparing it to an incubator, then consider thinking Preseed as an incubator that virtually incubates my startups first.
<br><br>
If Preseed likes you and your idea, it may consider supporting you with all it has got. If Preseed says yes to you, you will be aided beyond you can imagine.
<br><br>
<b>Q) What is virtual incubation?<br>
A)</b> An incubator that supports you like any other incubator but without a fixed physical space, or monetary investment.
For us to support people who are self-inspired, just an internet connection at their homes is sufficient.
<br><br>
 <b>Q) So if Preseed is not a typical incubator or a typical investor then what is Preseed ?</b><br>
This was an answer given by one of my advisors to someone who was not able to understand why we don’t care if the other startups understand us enough to come to us to use our services:
<br><br>
“Actually we are just a culture of sorts. A culture running under an unusual man’s leadership. It’s his imagination, courage, knowledge and intellect, and the act of our people that make us extremely valuable support to a man or a woman with a will to do something out of the ordinary.
<br><br>
The bottom line of trying to build some really cool companies out of our own ideas can be met in India, if we can successfully create a culture that makes their startup progression happen by way of our culture itself. For if they don’t succeed, they would have learnt the nuances to help us succeed in our products. So we are really a <b>culture</b> of liberated minds trying to do our thing in harmony with another. Let’s just say we as an organization are designed such that we find harmony in each other by way of who we are anyway”.
<br><br>
We are the guys who give you the fundamental idea, the product vision and its path.
<br><br> 
<b>Q) What does bring to the table in partnerships in which the product and the product vision is thoroughly already worked on?<br>
A)</b> Preseed brings the extraordinary minds and hence, the extraordinary creativity and hustle to the table on anything it touches upon. Read our website <a href="https://preseed.in" target="_blank">www.preseed.in</a> well.
<br><br>
<b>Q) Are you looking only for people to work on your specific ideas, Nishchal? How do you pick one over the others?</b><br>
I look for people mostly to work on my own consumer web ideas with, that is right. That is why I built Preseed in the first place. However, if there is ‘someone with an idea’ and or capability, that catches my fancy, I would be willing to put in all I can, into that idea too.
<br><br>
My experiences put me in a fairly good position to make judgments about what/who to pursue and what/who to say no to.
<br><br>
<b>Everything you do seems risky to me. What was the riskiest thing you have done so far, till turning 35 years of age?</b><br>
“Nothing is risky. It is all well thought of. Well, mostly.
<br><br>
Anyway, if we still have to point out something risky to the perspective of a mortal mind, that would be — at Preseed we have made some bad choices over the last few years, we have made a mistake of letting 3 really wrong people, at different times, to work with us. Mind you, we take righteousness very seriously. After they were laid off for their incapability/uselessness, deceitful vibes, and acts, they got together to start posting ill about us filled with baseless lies, frustration and hatred on public forums. One of them still keeps writing messages against us to our team members with an intent to bother them and to break relationships. Not only that, she went down to hatch a criminal conspiracy against Nishchal. What Nishchal did there after, is what makes him a hero, the world will sing songs about one day
<br><br>
We think these 3 men unfortunately got intimidated by our energy, outspokenness and levels of faith. Anyway, to each their own. Little do they know that greed, hate and lies fetch no one any good.
<br><br>
It was a seeming risk to have let them be a part of us for about 3–6 months to have them attempt damaging our culture of faith and love, with their deceit and hate. Their vibes from day one of their joining seemed tricky and greedy, we clearly took a risk by ignoring those vibes. We now know that even a day of having a hater (a person with a will to hate) in your company is a seeming risk of nurturing negative vibes under your wings for that day. And, we made a mistake of having 3 such men be under our wings for over 3 months. However, they had been fired out of our company long ago. We have forgiven the haters. May they find peace.
<br><br>
Although, such a risk of attracting sometimes the wrong men in a growing company cannot be fully avoided, but one can always be doubly alert and mindful.
<br><br>
Remember: <b>The vibe matters more than the skills. Trust your intuition about people”</b>
<br>
<b>Your thinking and words across your websites and videos seem like you will be better understood in Silicon Valley of America. Why are you still here? (Nishchal was asked this question in 2013)</b><br><br>
I like to be in the Himalayan region of India. It has some very knowledgable saints who are helping me progress further in my quest for exploring consciousness, that is, our identity outside of our body. Which I extrapolate often in terms of atoms and vibrations and silence and aum , and concentration of the mind deeply on a thought. USA was not the place for this topic. However it is a place for my other topic of technology ( which is linked with the laws of the creation of the universe from the point of god ) , but there it’s on the surface, yet quite advance, but the method I want to apply for the next 10 years, even in the way I manage Preseed, is more in tune with what can be found on the mountains of Himalayas.
<br><br>
In short, I am going with the flow, while being conscious of life and universe and me. 
but there the understanding of technological creation is outside the laws that govern the universe. Now of. course the place doesn’t matter. I carry my place or the mountains inside of me now.
<br><br>
<b>Q) I have an idea. How do I start engaging with you guys?<br><br>
A)</b> I recommend you to read <a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed/3c7dff3e0c64" target="_blank">this</a> and it’s surrounding links well. It will do a world of good to you. Contact us through our webpage.

        <p>
          On our mission towards empowering those who have the will to do s0mething out of the ordinary, we have covered
          some ground.

          "By the way this is just a start. It is not going to be perfect, yet. However, we have decided to dedicate our
          whole lives to the cause of meaningful technology entrepreneurship, regardless. We hope we are able to be of
          some impact there.

          Infact we have set up a self sustainable playground of sorts called Preseed Web Lab where some of you inspired
          ones can build with us web products, upon ideas that are definitely novel. Some of them may truly have the
          potential to change the world".

          This is the pitch that formed the goal of conducting these talks. As a result, Chattodo got built.

							 <br>
							I believe that in a contemporary society product leadership is enough. A mic and/or protests are not necessary.<br>
							 क्योंकि यह मैं मानता था कि आधुनिक जमाने की लीडर प्रोडक्ट्स से समाज में बदलाव ला सकते हैं। मैंने अपने 10 साल उसी प्रकार की लीडरशिप के माध्यम से एजुकेशन सिस्टम में चल रहे अन्याय को बदलने में लगा दिये है। आज उसका रिजल्ट यह है कि आप मेरी बनाई हुई चैटिंग एप और उसके संबंध मे लिखे हुये निबंध मे देख पाएंगे कि कैसे वार्तालाप और कर्मों के बीच भी ज्ञान दिया जा सकता है। एजुकेशन सिस्टम का अन्याय यह है कि उसने हर बच्चे किताब किताबी चार दिवारी में बंद कर दिया है। अब ना बच्चों के पास खुला वातावरण है और न ही फुर्सत, न ही गुरु है जिनसे प्रेरणा मिले| बच्चे अपनी आत्मा की कुर्बानी देकर ऐसे विद्यालय में दशियों साल समझौता कर रहे हैं मैं इस देश में यह सब बदलना चाहता था| यह बदलने के लिए मुझे लोकतंत्र के नेताओं और वोटों की शक्ति नहीं चाहिए थी, सिर्फ सॉफ्टवेयर इंजीनियर और मैनेजर की।

<b>The stars I am aiming for, just out of one tech product:</b><br>
1. To make all other todo listing, and note making apps redundant. (That will be a $1+ billion disruption)<br>
2. To then create, a social network of <b>action</b>. ($100+ billion disruption of current social network of talks).<br>
3. To then, create a culture of education upon communication and collaboration upon ones own ideas, using a field of artificial intelligence in the near future, NLP. ( $500 billion opportunity to create a new education landscape). Here education will happen just by chance.<br>
4. To then give preventive healthcare by measuring 5 elements in your body — earth, air, water, fire and ether.<br>
5. To then give you freedom from archaic education and healthcare systems.<br><br>

All through one app, this chat app, Chattodo. (To read more about it go to <a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in" target="_blank">chattodo.preseed.in</a>).

                We don’t do physical meetings unless:<br></br>
                1. There is a signed detailed letter of intent by you indicating clearly all of what you seek from us.
                It
                can simply be an email to us from your highest relevant authority.<br></br>
                2. A written acknowledgment that you have gone through our essays on Medium, linked to our services
                listed
                on our home page www.preseed.in.<br></br>
                3. You have made efforts through communication with us on Whatsapp chats, voice notes, video calls, and
                emails to minimize ambiguity towards clarity of our relationship.<br></br>
                4. You have then proceeded to talk to us over phone calls.<br></br>
                5. You may come to the place of our being. Our office is in New Delhi and Lucknow. However, we mostly
                work
                from remote locations like the mountains or sometimes, the beaches. You may check with us about our
                current
                whereabouts, and come to meet us there instead.<br></br>

                If most of the above is done, and now there is a genuine need of a physical meeting at your place of
                being,
                after having used web technology for meetings and video conferencing, you may proceed to transfer the
                amount
                equal to the cost of a to and fro air ticket for us and a reasonable stay in your city, no less than Rs.
                25,000 in total in our bank account, per person visiting you, from our side:<br></br>

                For bank account info reach Nishchal's executive assistant at <br> <a
                  href="mailto:info@gencosys.com">info@gencosys.in</a>
                &nbsp; cc:<a href="mailto:admin@preseed.in">admin@preseed.in</a>

                <br></br>
                Once done, you may intimate us on our email with all of the above and we will proceed to book our
                tickets
                to
                you shortly.<br></br>

                There’s nothing more annoying than meeting just to meet. Business meetings aren’t effective when a
                decision
                needs to be made or for informational purposes. You can take care of that with a simple phone call or a
                company-wide email with a plea for no reply.<br></br>

                Unless it’s a brainstorming session, a meeting should be called only to support and convey a previously
                made
                decision. A productive business meeting produces a committed plan of action. To stay on track, curb any
                irrelevant discussions, interruptions, and repeated points.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Begin the meeting before it starts.</b><br><br>
                “Prepare people ahead of time so you are all on the same page when you enter the room,” Wrike founder
                Andrew
                Filev advises. “Create notes and an agenda in advance and — here’s the tricky part — actually review
                them
                before the meeting starts.”<br><br>

                He also recommends putting key information someplace where participants can see it and discuss it in a
                running thread well before the actual meeting. “That way, the meeting is focused on solving problems and
                not
                just describing them,” he says. “The first 10 minutes of your meeting shouldn’t be a discussion of why
                you’re meeting.”<br><br>

                This essay is just our attempt to ensure the meeting or series of meetings during our physical presence
                with
                you are fruitful.<br></br>

                <b>Note -:</b> We detest the idea of meetings when there are more than 5 participants and ambiguous
                reasons
                for the presence of 5. We don’t however mind numerous silent observers.
                <br><br>
                If you have any doubt about our understandings of efficient meetings, google “meetings are inefficient”
                or
                “meetings kill productivity” etc. Having said that, we don’t mean that this is always true. However, it
                is
                mostly always true when the agenda of the meeting is not clear with a defined boundary unless the agenda
                itself is — boundless brainstorming.
